I also like anime and drawing- and I've gotten formally certified in game dev recently too :stuck_out_tongue:

Notable anime genres I'd be into: mecha anime and cyberpunk anime- also western (gunslinger) and vampire anime loll 😅 (As well as... I like Yōkai and monster slayer related series)

Plus I'm as well a Star Wars fan :P
